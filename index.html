    <p><strong>There are many professions in the world that require constant lecturing or performing with your voice being your main muscle group flexed throughout the day.<br> However, many of us do not worry about carefully maintaining a healthy vocal mechanism with a goal for maintaining good vocal quality for our entire life.<br> Here are a few basic life hacks to ease your voice and keep you speaking and singing beautifully for years to come!</strong></p> 
  
    <ol class="acmed">
        <li>
            Speak Effortlessly
        </li>

        <ul class="dosisd">
            <li>Speaking requires much less effort than we think. All we need to do is create a sound, then shape the vowels and consonants to be understood. You don’t need to clench anything to make a sound. I would suggest trying a relaxing vocal sigh, and memorizing that feeling. (Note: a yawn is close, but usually comes with a tongue that is pulled back causing a considerable amount of vocal tension) Once you have memorized that feeling, try speaking using that tone of voice. It has been described as “sing-songy” or “flowy” by my students, but it is undeniably less damaging, and healthier for your voice in the long run!</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            Utilize Good Posture

        </li>

        <ul class="dosisd">
            <li>Posture does not seem as obvious since our voice is inside of us and not connected to our back/feet/hands/etc… Try this out for me. Clench your fists very tight and be aware of what happens in your throat. Try saying something while you’re clenching your fists. Now relax your hands and be aware of how that feeling changes. It doesn’t have to be your fists, tension can be anywhere in your body and it can throw your voice out for a bit. Tension is the enemy of a healthy voice.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            Have Neck Alignment Awareness
        </li>

        <ul class="dosisd">
            <li>The <a href="https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/neck-pain/how-poor-posture-causes-neck-pain">Neck Alignment</a> stands in with the posture as well, but I think its important enough to have its own spot in this list. Many of us lean our neck forward to either look at our phones, lean into a TV screen, or nodding off in the subway. When you lean your head forward you are adding an immense burden on your neck every degree you add. When you’re completely rolled forward it can be as heavy to your neck as holding up sixty pounds! Resting your head on top of your spinal column instead of leaning it forward is key. Try this out. Sit up very tall and rotate your skull upwards and say something. Now rotate your skull downwards (keeping the good tall posture) and say the same thing. You should find that the upward position produces a “whinier” tone compared to the lower position. The sweet spot is on the lower side of the rotation where you can gently shake your head “no” without feeling any strain from your neck. Speaking with this neck alignment gives your voice the optimal location for natural projection and warmth in the tone. As a bonus your neck and body will thank you!</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            Have Jaw Awareness
        </li>

        <ul class="dosisd">
            <li>Everyone who has taken a biology class knows how joints work, but sometimes we glaze over some of the smaller details. It’s all about awareness. Our jaw hinges near our ears, but sometimes we think of it as hinging from the corner of our jawline. Rest your hands on your face by your ears and let your jaw open and close, and feel where it shifts. It takes a very small amount of effort to greatly open your jaw, and sometimes we use extra effort from surrounding muscles, when we don’t need to. Be aware of this tendency and try to limit it! Tension is the enemy of healthy singing!</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
            Treat your Voice like a Muscle
        </li>

        <ul class="dosisd">
           <li>Athletes all warm-up and hydrate regularly to keep their muscles happy and healthy, so you should too! Before you go for a big speaking lecture or singing production it is wise to do a few vocal warm-ups prior to starting. Humming is physically easier on the voice to produce a tone, so it is the preferred method for vocalists throughout the world. Also, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2925668/">be sure to drink water</a>. If you’re dehydrated you run the risk of  over exerting your vocal folds and that can lead to vocal nodes, vocal polyps or even vocal hemorrhaging. As Vocal Professor in college would always say, “Pee pale!”</li>
